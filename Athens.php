        <h3>About Athens</h3>
        <p>It's no wonder that all roads lead to the fascinating and maddening
          metropolis of Athens. Lift your eyes 200 feet above the city to the
          Parthenon, its honey-colored marble columns rising from a massive
          limestone base, and you’ll behold architectural perfection that has not
          been surpassed in 2,500 years. Today, this shrine of classical form
          dominates a 21st-century boomtown.

          Athens is home to 4.5 million souls, many of whom spend the day discussing
          the city's faults: the lack of city funding, the murky pollution cloud
          known as the nefos, the overcrowding, the traffic jams with their hellish
          din, the transport strikes, and the characterless cement apartment blocks.
          Romantic travelers, nurtured on the truth and beauty of Keats's Grecian
          urn, are dismayed to find that much of Athens has succumbed to that red
          tubular glare that owes only its name, neon, to the Greeks. But while
          Athens is a difficult city to love, its concentration of culture and
          lively spirit make it impossible to ignore.

          To experience Athens—Athìna in Greek—fully is to understand the essence
          of Greece: ancient monuments surviving in a sea of cement, startling
          beauty amid the squalor, tradition juxtaposed with modernity—a smartly
          dressed lawyer chatting on her cell phone as she maneuvers around a
          priest in flowing robes heading for the sleek, space-age metro. Locals
          depend on humor and flexibility to deal with the chaos and, lately, the
          raging economic crisis; you should do the same. The rewards are immense.
          To appreciate Athens is to appreciate life with all its surprises and
          complexities.</p>
