        <h3>About Rome</h3>
        <p>The "Eternal City" of Rome is the largest open-air museum in all of
          Europe with dozens of must-see, photogenic sites. Major attractions in
          the City Center are shown on the metro map above.

          Pantheon, RomeThe real charm of Rome is that you can easily walk to most
          sites. For example, after a mid-morning tour of the impressive Pantheon,
          one could stroll through Piazza Navona, enjoy a gelato in Campo De Fiori,
          then walk across the historic Ponte Sisto Bridge into Trastevere - Rome's
          oldest neighborhood - for an enjoyable lunch. Total miles walked? Less
          than three!

          From Trastevere, it's only a 20-minute walk along the Tiber to the Vatican.
          After a tour of Saint Peter's Basilica, another short walk to Castel St.
          Angelo, where the best views of Rome are found atop that impressive castle.

          As you can see, Rome is a walkable city, and by walking you get a real
          feel for the ambiance of Rome and the Italian way of life. Good, free
          walking maps are available all over the city, so hit the cobblestones.

          Italy was certainly influenced by many powerful cultures and political
          forces over time, including the Byzantines, Etruscans and Greeks, but
          it was the world-changing impact of both the Roman civilization and the
          Italian Renaissance that contributed most-significantly to its status
          in the modern world.</p>
